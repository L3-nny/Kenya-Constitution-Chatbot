    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "A nation's Constitution serves as its foundational legal framework, outlining the structure of government, the rights and duties of citizens, and the principles that guide the rule of law. In the case of the Constitution of Kenya, it establishes the basis for democratic governance, justice, and the protection of human rights. It is a critical document that influences both the operation of state institutions and the freedoms of individuals. Therefore, it is crucial for every citizen to have access to and understand their country's Constitution.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, many people face challenges when trying to access and comprehend the Constitution, particularly if they are unfamiliar with legal language or the document’s structure. This project seeks to address these obstacles by creating a question-answering system focused on the Constitution of Kenya.

    "## Modeling\n",
    "***\n",
    "The system’s core functionality lies in its Question-Answering Mechanism, designed to interpret user queries accurately and retrieve the most relevant constitutional sections. This is achieved through advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Natural Language Understanding (NLU) components, which work in tandem to understand, match, and respond to user questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question-Answering Mechanism\n",
    "#### Matching User Queries\n",
    "* **answer_question_nlp Function:** This custom function analyzes user queries for keywords and phrases, matching them to relevant sections in the qa_mapping database, which is structured to cover critical constitutional topics. The function’s matching mechanism ensures that user questions are directed to the correct sections, regardless of variations in wording.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### NLP Techniques\n",
    "* **Named Entity Recognition (NER):** Leveraging spaCy’s NER capabilities, the system identifies and highlights essential entities in user queries, such as \"President,\" \"rights,\" and \"court.\" This step aids in narrowing down relevant sections by directly mapping the entities to specific articles or sub-sections within the Constitution.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Semantic Similarity Scoring:** To handle diverse query phrasing, the bot calculates semantic similarity scores, allowing it to match terms with similar or alternative wording. For example, queries containing terms like \"entitlements\" are effectively matched to sections on \"rights,\" increasing the system's robustness in interpreting different user expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Query Expansion:** To ensure high response accuracy, the model employs query expansion techniques that enhance its ability to recognize variations of key legal terms. This way, synonyms and related terms are captured, broadening the model’s understanding and ability to retrieve accurate responses for users.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Natural Language Understanding (NLU) \n",
    "The NLU component is integral to interpreting the purpose of a user’s query, focusing on Intent Recognition, Entity Recognition, and Response Matching:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Intent Recognition:** The NLU module discerns the underlying intent of user questions, mapping them to predefined legal themes. For instance, queries like “What are my rights?” or “Explain judiciary powers” are linked to topics such as citizens' rights and judicial authority, facilitating accurate document retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Entity Recognition:** Essential entities within user queries (e.g., “President,” “court system,” “constitution”) are identified and used to pinpoint sections within the Constitution. This helps the bot retrieve text that aligns closely with the user's inquiry by understanding specific legal terms and names.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Response Matching:** By combining intent recognition and entity identification, the NLU module prioritizes the most relevant sections, ensuring that responses align closely with the intended question. This matching process improves the bot’s precision and accuracy, especially for queries that may overlap in meaning across different sections.\n",
