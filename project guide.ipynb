    "## 1. User Input Validation\n",
    "Ensure that the chatbot can handle various types of input errors gracefully, such as typos, incomplete questions, or ambiguous queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Spell Check & Correction: Use tools like pyspellchecker or integrate a custom dictionary of constitutional terms to detect and correct common misspellings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Partial Matches: If the user enters a fragment or a slightly incorrect term, implement fuzzy matching with libraries like fuzzywuzzy or difflib to find the closest match to valid keywords.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prompting for Clarification: When the input is ambiguous, ask the user follow-up questions for clarity. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "User Input: \"Bill of Rights\"\n",
    "Bot Response: \"Did you mean 'Bill of Rights' in Chapter 4 or Chapter 1 (Introduction)?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Natural Language Understanding (NLU)\n",
    "Enhance the bot's understanding of user queries by integrating Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools, allowing the chatbot to understand the intent behind queries better.\n",
    "\n",
    "Intent Detection: Use spaCy's pre-trained models or train a custom intent recognition model to identify the user’s purpose beyond keyword searches. This can help you understand if the user is seeking a definition, clarification, or example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Synonyms & Related Terms: Create a list of synonyms or closely related legal terms. For instance, if a user searches for \"freedom\" and the constitution uses \"liberty,\" map such terms together.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Error Handling for Complex Queries\n",
    "If users ask complex or multi-part questions, build logic to break down and process each part separately. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "User Input: \"What does Chapter 1 say about sovereignty and the people?\"\n",
    "Bot Response: It could retrieve sections on both \"sovereignty\" and \"people\" separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Feedback Loops\n",
    "Include a way for users to confirm if the retrieved result was helpful. If not, allow them to refine the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bot: \"Did I find what you were looking for?\"\n",
    "User: \"No.\"\n",
    "Bot: \"Please rephrase or provide more details.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Pre-emptive Suggestions\n",
    "Before returning the exact section, you can offer pre-emptive suggestions based on the user’s query.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bot: \"It looks like you're asking about 'Sovereignty'. Would you like to see related sections on 'Citizenship' or 'Democracy' as well?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Caching Frequently Asked Queries\n",
    "Implement a caching mechanism for frequently accessed sections of the Constitution. This can significantly reduce response times for common queries, making the chatbot feel faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Logging and Learning from Errors\n",
    "Track user queries that fail to return meaningful results, then refine the chatbot by either expanding its knowledge base or improving its keyword matching. This can also help you improve the FAQ section over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. Support for Multiple Languages\n",
    "If relevant, you could expand the chatbot's functionality by supporting different languages. For example, you could add Kiswahili translations of constitutional sections to increase accessibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9. Search Ranking\n",
    "If a query could return multiple sections, rank the responses based on relevance using techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) or embedding-based similarity with word vectors."
