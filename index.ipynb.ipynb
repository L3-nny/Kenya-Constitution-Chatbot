    "In Kenya, there is a significant gap in public understanding of the Constitution. Many citizens, including students, legal practitioners, and the general public, often face challenges when trying to access information on constitutional rights, duties, and legal interpretations. The complex legal language used in the Constitution can be intimidating, undermining public comprehension. This lack of understanding can lead to confusion about legal matters and reduced engagement in civic duties, as well as hinder individuals' ability to seek justice and engage meaningfully with governance. By addressing these issues, the proposed platform aims to simplify access to constitutional knowledge, empowering individuals to advocate for their rights and participate actively in the democratic process.\n",
