    "A nation's Constitution serves as its foundational legal framework, outlining the structure of government, the rights and duties of citizens, and the principles that guide the rule of law. In the case of the Constitution of Kenya, it establishes the basis for democratic governance, justice, and the protection of human rights. It is a critical document that influences both the operation of state institutions and the freedoms of individuals. Therefore, it is crucial for every citizen to have access to and understand their country's Constitution.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, many people face challenges when trying to access and comprehend the Constitution, particularly if they are unfamiliar with legal language or the documentâ€™s structure. This project seeks to address these obstacles by creating a question-answering system focused on the Constitution of Kenya. Utilizing supervised machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques, this system will allow users to ask questions about the Constitution and receive accurate answers in real time, directly sourced from the document's content.\n",
    "\n",
    "By developing this system, the project aims to foster a deeper understanding of constitutional rights and responsibilities among users. It is designed to empower individuals by improving access to crucial legal information, encouraging civic engagement, and supporting legal education. This tool will provide an accessible and user-friendly way to navigate the complexities of the Constitution, helping users, including legal professionals and the general public, better understand their rights and the workings of the law in Kenya.\n",
    "### Business Problem\n",
    "In Kenya, there is a significant gap in public understanding of the Constitution. Many citizens, including students, legal practitioners, and the general public, often face challenges when trying to access information on constitutional rights, duties, and legal interpretations. The complex legal language used in the Constitution can be intimidating, undermining public comprehension. This lack of understanding can lead to confusion about legal matters and reduced engagement in civic duties, as well as hinder individuals' ability to seek justice and engage meaningfully with governance. By addressing these issues, the proposed platform aims to simplify access to constitutional knowledge, empowering individuals to advocate for their rights and participate actively in the democratic process.\n",
